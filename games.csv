1574141701931,Tue Nov 19 2019 00:35:01 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),stage,Operation Cyber Fortress - LOW,3,"Cyberspace threats against our Kingdom are growing. Cyber attackers seek personal information about our decision-makers, our government officials, and our military personnel. We have confirmed Illyrian cyber attacks against other countries that have included operations against government research and development programs. Our intelligence and national security agencies are concerned about Illyrian activities on our networks that, beyond intelligence-gathering, could position them in a crisis or war to undermine our ability to make decisions as a government and fight a war. Finally, we suspect that Illyria was behind the cyber operations that led to the theft of confidential documents and their subsequent posting on the internet in an apparent effort to undermine our King's reputation and our peoples' confidence in core political and social institutions. These activities bear the hallmarks of Illyria and while we have internally attributed many of these attacks to them, we have not made an explicit external announcement to date.;One of your mission sets is to reduce the impact of these attacks and begin to seize the initiative back from Illyrian cyber forces, who have been active against us, and put them off-balance and more on-guard. We expect you to conduct cyber operations and design campaigns that will protect our systems and the Kingdom.",""

Illirya has employed multiple spearphishing attacks against us, which are often part of their broader campaigns. Additionally, our assets have been targets of denial of service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. We cannot confirm attribution to Illyria, but prepositioned malware in our critical infrastructure has been found. Overall, we are responding to a broad range of Illyrian hostile activities in cyberspace, including, but not limited to those listed above.",""

We have a diverse cyber tool-kit at our disposal, including capabilities such as zero day exploits. We have been successful in prepositioning malware in Illyrian infrastructure that provides reconnaisance, and the potential for disruption, degradation, or destruction of their critical infrastructure. However, overall our capabilities and number of expert personnel across mission sets remain limited, so we must prioritize the use of our forces to specific missions and operations at any given time.",""

While the Kingdom of Illyria is richer and its economy stands at 13 trillion ducats, as opposed to the Kingdom of Dardania's 1 trillion ducats, we have protected ourselves by being proactive in our security. The King regards cyberspace as a strategic envrionment through which we can advance Dardania's national interests.",""
