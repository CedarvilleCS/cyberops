The second option, a DDOS attack, was advertised to only slow or degrade the enemy's abilities to engage us. This is not good enough, and we have limited forces to carry out such an attack.

The fourth option, to turtle up and achieve security, is not feasible as they are already inside our servers. Not engaging the enemy here is allowing them to maintain superiority and momentum.

The last option is illegal. Conventional war is not yet on the table, in my opinion.

The correct option is to act offensively in a way that meaningfully destroys their ability to engage us and has a high probability of success. They will be on edge after celebrating their recent victories and this gives us breathing room, time to secure ourselves, and rebuild our forces.
