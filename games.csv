1571799265279,Tue Oct 22 2019 22:56:01 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),stage,Scenario 1,0,Welcome to your first day as the Commander for the Kingdom of Dardania's Cyber Command.,
1571799265279,Tue Oct 22 2019 22:56:01 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),stage,Scenario 1,1,We have been building toward a major cyber campaign; which you will now command. We have prepared a short briefing for you to prepare you for your decision to commence operations and oversee the cyber campaign. This briefing is focused on our main rival; the Kingdom of Illyria. ,
1571799265279,Tue Oct 22 2019 22:56:01 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),stage,Scenario 1,2,Commander; this briefing also will explain the operational options at your disposal for countering cyber operations undertaken by Illyrian forces as well as our plans to persist against Illyria with an effort to gain the initiative (advantage) on them in cyberspace.,
1571799265279,Tue Oct 22 2019 22:56:01 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),stage,Scenario 1,3,Cyberspace threats against our Kingdom are growing. We have been forced to protect against cyber attacks that seek personal information about our decision-makers; government officials; and our military personnel. We have confirmed Illyrian cyber attacks against other countries that have included operations against government research and development programs. Our intelligence and national security agencies are concerned about Illyrian activities on our networks that; beyond intelligence-gathering; could position them in a crisis or war to undermine our ability to make decisions as a government and fight a war. Finally; we suspect that Illyria was behind the cyber operations that led to the theft of confidential documents and their subsequent posting on the internet in an apparent effort to undermine our King's reputation and our peoples' confidence in core political and social institutions. These activities bear the hallmarks of Illyria and while we have internally attributed many of these attacks to them; we have not made an explicit external announcement to date.~One of your mission sets is to reduce the impact of these attacks and begin to seize the initiative back from Illyrian cyber forces; who have been active against us and put them off-balance and more on-guard. We expect you to conduct cyber operations and design campaigns that will protect our systems and the Kingdom.,
1571799265279,Tue Oct 22 2019 22:56:01 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),stage,Scenario 1,4,While we have been a target of state and non-state actors alike; our main focus is on the Kingdom of Illyria. Illirya has employed against us multiple spearphishing attacks; which are often part of their broader campaigns. Additionally; our assets have been targets of denial of service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. We cannot confirm attribution to Illyria; but prepositioned malware in our critical infrastructure has been found. Overall; we are responding to a broad range of Illyrian hostile activities in cyberspace; including; but not limited to those listed above.,
1571799265279,Tue Oct 22 2019 22:56:01 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),stage,Scenario 1,5,While we reserve the right to respond to Illyrian attacks by all means available; both cyber and conventional military; we aim to be proportional in our response. We have a diverse cyber tool-kit at our disposal; including capabilities such as zero day exploits. We have been successful in prepositioning malware in Illyrian infrastructure that provides reconnaisance; and the potential for disruption; degradation; or destruction of their critical infrastructure. However; overall our capabilities and number of expert personnel across mission sets remain limited; so we must prioritize the use of our forces to specific missions and operations at any given time.,
1571799265279,Tue Oct 22 2019 22:56:01 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),stage,Scenario 1,6,Although the two kingdoms are currently at peace; the Kingdom of Illyria; as you know; has been a long-term rival.  While the Kingdom of Illyria is richer and its economy stands at 13 trillion ducats; as opposed to 1 trillion ducats in Kingdom of Dardania; we have protected ourselves by being proactive in our security. The King regards cyberspace as a strategic envrionment through which we can advance Dardania's national interests.,
1571799265279,Tue Oct 22 2019 22:56:01 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),stage,Scenario 1,7,In terms of the cyber capabilities under your Command; we have the capacity to detect; deny; disrupt; degrade and deceive through cyber means all of the seven elements of typical cyber attacks; which include Reconnaisance (mapping networks); Weaponization (malware tailored to vulnerabilities); Delivery; Exploitation (leveraging a vulnerability to execute code) ; Installation (placing malware); Command and Control (remote manipulation); Actions on Objectives (through CC achieve mission).,
1571799265279,Tue Oct 22 2019 22:56:01 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),stage,Scenario 1,8,Our 2nd Cyber Brigade has engaged in a successful intelligence-gathering operation which has indicated that Illyria is developing significant cyber capabilities that may overmatch our own cyber forces; particularly our ability to protect our networks as well as engage in counter-cyber operations effectively. ,
1571799265279,Tue Oct 22 2019 22:56:01 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),stage,Scenario 1,9,The King has authorized you to commence a cyber campaign against Illyria with the objective of gaining significant intelligence about their cyber capabilities and use that intelligence to initiate cyber manipulation of their cyber capabilities to make them ineffective when Illyria actually seeks to deploy them against us. Your goal is to undermine covertly their malware research and development capacity.,
1571799265279,Tue Oct 22 2019 22:56:01 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),stage,Scenario 1,10,During this mission; it is essential that your soldiers remain undetected and that our overall campaign remain covert. Simultaneous to this campaign; Dardanian Cyber Command must guarantee that our nation's critical networks remain safe and fully functioning.,
1571799265279,Tue Oct 22 2019 22:56:01 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),stage,Scenario 1,11,The first step in our campaign is to gain access to key servers in Illyria. Preparations for this Operation has identified the Illyrian Ministry of Defense as a key node in their overall national network. From this point forward you are in charge of Operation Cyber Fortress. The King looks forward to your reports of success. You are now in full operational control.,
1571799265279,Tue Oct 22 2019 22:56:01 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),stage,Scenario 1,12,Commander; we have prepared a comprehensive spear-phishing attack for which we have high confidence of success. Please use your attack menu to authorize this operation. ,Launch Spear-Phishing Attack

The target opened the spearphishing email and clicked on the attachment. Dardania has just gained access into Illyria's networks. It appears that our target has opened the Excel file we sent and the trojan has been activated; and the backdoor installed. I am pleased to say that we now have access to the network of the Ministry of Defense of the Kingdom of Illyria and will begin our mapping activities in search of their malware development.,
